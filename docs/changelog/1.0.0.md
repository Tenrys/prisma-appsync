## 👀 Full Changelog

### 👉 Prisma-AppSync officially stable!

Exciting news! Prisma-AppSync has achieved stability and is already in use in multiple production projects. Time to celebrate the release of v1.0.0!

### 👉 Enhanced `@gql` and `@auth` directives for finer control

The `@gql` directive has been updated to provide more detailed control over CRUD operations:

```prisma
// before: only top-level rules were supported
@gql(queries: null, mutations: null)

// after: define specific rules for each CRUD operation
@gql(queries: { list: null, count: null }, mutations: { update: null, delete: null })
```

Same goes with the `@auth` directive, allowing granular access rules per operation:

```prisma
// before: only top-level rules were supported
@auth(queries: [{ allow: iam }])

// after: individual rules for specific query operations
@auth(queries: { list: [{ allow: iam }] })
```

Field-level authorization is now possible with the `@auth` directive:

```prisma
// newly supported field-level authorization rules
@auth(fields: { password: [{ allow: apiKey }] })
```

The `defaultDirective` in the prisma-appsync generator config is now optional, providing flexibility in configurations:

```prisma
generator appsync {
  provider = "prisma-appsync"
  // `defaultDirective` can be specified or omitted
  defaultDirective = "@auth(model: [{ allow: iam }])"
}
```

When provided, `defaultDirective` seamlessly integrates with model-specific directives:

```prisma
// specified 'defaultDirective' for all models:
@auth(model: [{ allow: iam }])

// additional 'model directive' for enhanced control:
@auth(model: [{ allow: apiKey }])

// resulting merged directive for the model:
@auth(model: [{ allow: iam }, { allow: apiKey }])
```

### 👉 Generator Revamp for improved GraphQL Schema output

The Generator package has been totally rewritten to address reported issues and unlock a slew of new features. This not only makes the GraphQL Schema output more concise and well-optimized but also ensures Prisma-AppSync is ready for what's next.

With the largest production schemas, this revamp has led to a reduction of up to 500 lines in the GraphQL Schema output.

::: info AppSync GraphQL Schema Diff
To see the before/after with your own schema or simply compare two different AppSync Schemas, we've published a free online tool: [AppSync GraphQL Schema Diff](https://prisma-appsync.vercel.app/tools/appsync-gql-schema-diff.html).

### 👉 Streamlined Model Relations: Create[Model]Without[Relation]Input

With the generator revamp, you can now create, update, or upsert any Model Relation (like Author) tied to a particular Model (such as Post) in just one GraphQL query. This eliminates the previous, more cumbersome process of inserting each Model separately and then manually associating them. The improvement is in sync with the Prisma Client API, offering a more streamlined and developer-friendly approach.

```gql
mutation {
  createPost(
    data: {
      title: "Example post"
      author: {
        connectOrCreate: {
          where: { name: "John Doe" }
          create: { name: "John Doe" }
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    title
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### 👉 Default input values are now visible in your GraphQL IDE

Default values for input fields are now clearly displayed in your GraphQL IDE. For instance, the example below clearly indicates that 'views' defaults to '0' and 'isPublished' to 'false'.

```gql
# example GraphQL grammar
input PostCreateInput {
  content: String
  views: Int = 0
  isPublished: Boolean = false
}
```

### 👉 Breaking changes to streamline values in `Context.alias`

To streamline values in the `Context.alias` type, the `modify` alias has been renammed to `mutate`, and `batchModify` is now referred to as `batchMutate`.

### 👉 Added support for `AWS_LAMBDA` authorization mode

You can now utilize `AWS_LAMBDA` as an authorization mode with the `@auth` directive:

```prisma
// AWS_LAMBDA
@auth(model: [{ allow: lambda }])
```
